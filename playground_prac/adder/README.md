# Adder
## what does it do?
it adds two array representation of an integer (1200 as [1,2,0,0]) and returns the vlaue that was added altogether 
`[1,2,0,0] + [2,3,1,9] = [3,5,1,9]`

## how does it work?
a whole lot of krudge. basically it will construct String representation of the array, it will convert that String into Int, and it will add them together. and then, it will return the Int value as an array 

## what's the point of this?
just another programming challenge thingy. plus I am bored at Apple Store so i need to do something productive.
