        //  so think of optional as a schrendinger's cat. you put a cat in a box(optional) with a poision bottle. you don't know if the cat is alive or dead until you open the box. same principle. you don't know if the variable is nil or have some value until you unwrap it with ! operator

            print ("car is self-driving to " + destination!)  //"!" means force unwrapping, it translate String? into String, note that String? and String are different data types. if destination is NIL, you will see NIL pointer exception, your program will crash, your cat will die and you will be sad and eat ice cream until you have heart disease.
