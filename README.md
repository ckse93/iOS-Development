# iOS-Development

## introduction 
This is my personal learning repository for iOS development. I am using London App brewery's skeleton project so I do not have to be artsy and stuff. Im bad at graphic design.
Each repository will have projct folder which will contain a project and readme, if i wasnt too lazy to write those. 


## Swift practice dir
this is where you will find most of my swift practices. Swift is great, but programming side by side with java oftentimes can be confusing and i need some space:milky_way: to put them in
