# Clima

## Project Overview and Objectives 
- this is a simple weather app that utilizes skeleton proj from LondonAppBrewery
- to be able to utilize API calls and manipulate JSON, using external libraries (cocoapods)
- to be able to pass data back and forth between multiple view controllers, using segues and protocol 
  - think of protocol as a ..... sorta of Abstract class, you have to implement it, and redefine it to be able to use it. or compiler gets mad and blow everything up. thats how Terminator movie started. 
  
## Toolset needed
- SwiftyJSON
  - used to do JSON stuff. there is no way you could have guessed just by looking at the lib name
- Alamofire
  - handling https requests asynchronously (yes i spelled it right!)
- Protocol 
  - REMEMBER to declare in the view controller you pass data from, define it in the view controller you get the data.
- Location 
  - permissssssyeon

## Tips
- error handling. DO NOT FORGET. it will blow your stuff up. 
- commit regularly. forreal
